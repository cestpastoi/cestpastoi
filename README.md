- 👀 I’m interested in a flashcard app named anki
- 🌱 I will be currently learning how to use it
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anki and any learning tool
- 📫 How to reach me? dont' know yet where I am ...
- 😄 Pronouns: "you" is fine with me, i really don't care
- ⚡ Fun fact: no clue how I came here, was only exploring which anki version to download on a very old pc
